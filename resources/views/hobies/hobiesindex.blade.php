          <p>I have many hobies in my life, but two biggest are basketball and books. </p>
          <p>I'm in love with the game of basketball sinc my 7th year, when I started to play it. My first club was Banovo brdo, local basketball club in my neighbourhood. In 2002 I continue playing in BC Sava, also from Belgrade and with this club I won Belgrade league for juniors in 2003. I finished my basketball career in 2005 in Torlak. </p>
          <P>After my short career I continue playing basketball with my friends and watching when I have free time. I also worked as a basketball individual coach and as a recruter for basketball players for the US colleges. </P>
          <P>Beside basketball, as I already mentioned, I like reading books. Whenever I have time, I relax myself with a good book, so I you have some recomendation, you have my contacts, so please sendit to me. I have many writter which I would recomend to you, but one book left the biggest impression on me and that's "Roman about London" by Miloš Crnjanski, so if you didn't, you should read it.</P>
